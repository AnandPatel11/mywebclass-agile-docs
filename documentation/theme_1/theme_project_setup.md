## Initiatives

1. **Develop initial project documentation to establish a clear project scope:** The success of this initiative will be measured by a review of the project documentation by all stakeholders to ensure that the scope is well-defined, accurate, and aligned with our business objectives.

2. **Set up CI/CD DevOps processes for efficient and collaborative development practices:** The success of this initiative will be measured by the speed and efficiency of the development process, as well as the level of collaboration between team members.

3. **Create an initial web page template with the following features:**
   - Monitoring to continuously improve the quality of our project
   - Website analytics to collect data that can be used to continuously improve MyWebClass for our community members
   - Project metrics to continuously improve the management of the project

The success of this initiative will be measured by the functionality and effectiveness of the web page template, as well as the level of engagement and satisfaction of our community members.
